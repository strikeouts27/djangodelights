        object_list is a list of menu item objects created by django
        the difference between the two is item holds menuitem information held in the class
        where as object list is just a list of the objects with queryset-->

                it uses filter method and returns a list of recipe requirement objects
                see the code in models.py that shows that method.
                requirement is a recipe class object because the requirements function 
                used the recipe requirement class. 
                Since the function returns a list of recipe requirement objects we can access the individual
                requirements using a for loop and dot notation. we use dot notation and look at the receipe requirements model
                and choose the ingredients field to access the ingredient names -->
